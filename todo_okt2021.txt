TODO:

Functionality:
- More robust/scalable way of creating the HTML pages
- Tiling to be more robust
- write a test suite to make it an official github repo that can be added to
- Create reference image uses .first(), but that is a random one in the context of Nextflow since the order isn't guarantied
- Create more options for registering, if people care about that sorta thing
- better spot detection, or more options
- work out normalization, instead of just saying "oh yeah this seemed to work"
- add graph-based decoding 
- Fix plotting assigned genes on a large scale, that for some reason got stuck everytime, still no clue why


MERFISH
- get rid of the requirement that the images have to be 16-bit
- register wrt to a choice of image, not just to the random first one that asynchronously enters the function
- Improve decoding to be more scalable by means of a more intelligent find nearest neighbour searching algorithm instead of just hardcoding it.



Style:
- Naming convention of workflow hierarchy
- write a better/more accurate help message
- Function documentation
- code documentation
- config documentation
- documentation website
- add css to the html templates
- try and get rid of the transform function for the global coördinates, it's gross
- merge things like "pad round" and "pad reference" into one, and work the differences out with a variable
- merge ISS and MERFISH similar functions like segmentation into one workflow that again adapts according to the config file
- remove memory unfriendly registering
- clean up segmentation workflows and only keep the usefull ones

Potential refactoring:
- Tiling
- naming / regular expression convention
