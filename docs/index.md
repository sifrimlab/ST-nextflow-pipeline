Welcome to STAPLE. This website represents everything you need to know about the end-to-end framework 
that allows you to customize and run a completely automated pipeline to process your Spatial Transcriptomic dataset.

### Context
This project was created as the basis of my thesis "Development of an automated data
analysis framework for highly-multiplexed transcriptomic assays", in the context of my final Master's year in Bioinformatics at the KU Leuven. 

The development of the framework will be continued within the scope of my PhD in the same hostlab, the Laboratory of Laboratory of Multi-omic Integrative Bioinformatics (lmib), under the superivision of Prof. Alejandro Sifrim.
